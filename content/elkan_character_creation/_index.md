When generating a character in Elkan, there are a few things that make the process different than generating one for most 5e settings.

### Setting Specific

* Angels and demons are each tied to a particular virtue or sin. There are no devils, though sometimes the word is used to describe creatures that look like demons but are really something else.

* Gods are present and walk among mortals.

### Race Specific

* Dark elves live on the surface in the middle of the jungles. They all belong to one of twelve Merchant States. The dark dwarves live in isolated communities in the same region.
* Wood elves and forest gnomes live in the southern forests together as one people.
* High elves live on their island of Ishiki and rarely leave, and when they do, they are generally referred to as wood elves.
* Rock gnomes are a warrior people in service to their god of light, Glanis.
* Humans live under and worship angels and their virtues in the Solar Hegemony. Humans have spread elsewhere, most notably to House Lawry, one of the Merchant States.
* Halflings are ruthless matriarchal slavers. They value family and country above all else. They are constantly besieged by Malakai, flesh monsters made of corpses.
* Tieflings and Aasimar are often more closely related to their infernal or celestial parent than in most settings. Additionally, all angels and demons have a virtue or sin that influences their offspring.
* Most dwarves and all dragonborn are connected magically to the blood of one of the dragon gods.
* Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears are all part of the Hobgoblin Empire, and live under the immortal Ancestors of the hobgoblins. They are more civilized than in most settings.
* Orcs are split into clans, and are well known as brutal warmongers. Still, they're about as intelligent as a human. One clan broke off from the others and worships their vampire rulers.

### Class Specific

* Clerics: Your cleric likely knows someone who's met their god, or met their god personally.
* Warlocks: If you choose the fiend pact, your patron will have a particular sin it wants you to spread through the world. If you choose the great old one, your patron probably wants the end of the world, though perhaps not in your lifetime.

### Renown Abilities

Each character comes with a renown ability. These abilities can be linked to your race, or a campaign-specific backstory. The idea is that these renown abilities represent something you or your race is known for. You may have a renown ability normally associated with another race if you were raised among them. The idea was to allow for racial abilities that aren't inborn to be more flexible, and to allow specific character concepts to be mechanically distinguished from others.
